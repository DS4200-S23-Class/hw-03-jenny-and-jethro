                <ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Represents attribute of categorical type. </li>
                            <li>This is a good mapping because it follows the effectiveness principle and contributes to how digestible the visualization is. Each area is positioned relative to each other in a way that helps users easily differentiate between them and identify which one correlates to what U.S. state. Though position is not entirely what users depend on to identify the states, this channel does play a significant role in their ability to do so. Additionally, the positioning of the states aligns with how they are objectively arranged geographically. The positioning of the states also does not majorly interfere with other channels, even though both positioning and shape are used to indicate a state. Hawaii pops out in terms of positioning since it is separated from the other states on the map, but the use of hue overrides this effect. Finally, while some states may be grouped together based on region, this effect is also appropriately dominated by the use of hues. The expressiveness principle is also followed because the way the information is shown does not imply an ordering exists among the categorical attributes. Hence, the states are correctly interpreted as categorical data. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <!-- <li>Shape
                        <ul>
                            <li>Represents attribute of categorical type.</li>
                            <li>This is a good mapping because it plays a major role as to how well users are able to distinguish between each area and identify the state it represents, which shows how this channel follows the effectiveness principle.  The shape channel helps to emphasize which states would have given its electoral votes to Clinton versus Trump. Each state is clearly distinguished by the unique shapes they yield. It helps that these shapes align with common knowledge people have regarding a state's geography (i.e. knowing Louisiana has a boot shape). Since the shape's borders are clearly marked and no shape closely resembles another, each state is very differentiable. The shaping of the states does not overtly interfere with other channels, even though positioning is also used to indicate a state. States like Texas, which has a unique L-shape, may pop out from the other states due to its size, but the colors on the plot detract this effect's impact. Some states may also be grouped based on size, but this information is appropriately overshadowed by color. The expressiveness principle is followed as well because the way the information is shown does not imply an ordering exists among this categorical attribute. The states are correctly perceived as strictly categorical data.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li> -->
                    <li>Color (Hue)
                        <ul>
                            <li>Represents attribute of categorical type.</li>
                            <li>This is a good mapping because hue helps users clearly identify which party each states' electoral votes would have went to, which is the main data that the visualization is trying to convey to users. The visualization uses two distinct colors to represent each party, which shows that both the effectiveness and expressiveness principles are followed. Semantically, Democrats are psychologically associated with blue while Republicans are associated with red, so the color choices make sense. This channel exists sufficiently independently of others. The only state that pops out due to the color channel is Nebraska, which contains both red and blue. We believe this finding to be interesting and hence appropriately popped out. Furthermore, the two distinct colors very clearly group the states into two categories: those of which would have given its electoral votes to Clinton (blue), and those of which would have given its electoral votes to Trump (red). This color grouping dominates other groupings suggested by other channels. Considering that one of the main intents of the visualization is to help users discover which states would have given its electoral votes to Clinton or Trump if the voting population was solely female, this grouping effect is justifiable. Furthermore, the way the data is shown does not imply an ordering exists among this categorical attribute. The states are again correctly portrayed as categorical data.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Area -> Length
                        <ul>
                            <li>Represents attribute of quantitative/sequential type.</li>
                            <li>This is a good mapping because both the effectiveness and expressiveness principles are followed. The length of the blue part of the bar above the map compared to the red helps users clearly identify which candidate would have won the 2016 presidential election if just women voted.  This information contributes to the main message the visualization is trying to convey to users. The segmented bar uses two appropriately colored bars of different lengths to represent each candidate. The bars appear to accurately match our perceptual judgment of how many electoral votes a candidate would have received in relation to the objective measurement. The use of color helps to ensure each bar is clearly distinguished. The bars exist independently of the map below, but the colors on the bars appropriately correlate to the colors on the map based on which candidate each represents. Clinton's bar justifyingly pops out due to how long it is compared to Trump's.  This pop-out effect stresses that much more women voted for Clinton in the 2016 presidential election than Trump. No distinct groups can be made, which is appropriate. Furthermore, the way that length is incorporated as a channel does not imply that the number of electoral votes a candidate received is a categorical or ordinal attribute. The number of theoretical electoral votes for each candidate correctly is portrayed as quantitative data: the longer the bar, the more electoral votes a candidate would have received.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Represents attribute of categorical type (Clinton or Trump).</li>
                            <li>This is a good mapping. The colors used in this visualization are of similar saturation and value, but are perceptually distant. From this instance, users can see that there are two distinct categories (states that would have provided its electoral votes to Clinton against those that would have provided them to Trump) that the visualization is focusing on. No illusions are created via saturation, mark typing and sizing, simultaneous contrast, or the Von Bezold Spreading Effect.</li>

                    <br><h2>Marks</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Points</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br><h2>Channels</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Position --> Both
                            <ul>
                                <li>Represents attribute of ordered (quantitative/diverging for launch angle and quantitative/sequential for exit velocity) types.</li>
                                <li>This is a good mapping. Each point has two corresponding attributes: launch angle and exit velocity. In this visualization, the creator used both horizontal and vertical positioning to clearly and efficiently display these attributes. Additionally, the position channel correctly shows that some sort of order does exist based on each point's horizontal and vertical position relative to other points. Thus, the exit velocity and launch angle data are most likely to be correctly interpreted as quantitative measurements. The insertion of markings above and below where the launch angle equals 0 emphasizes that the launch angle is a diverging attribute. The positioning also makes logical sense: points below the middle of the plot symbolize negative launch angles that decrease further down the graph while those above represent positive launch angles that increase further up the graph. Additionally, points further to the right of the plot have higher exit velocities. The x and y axes are scaled evenly, enabling us to make perceptual judgements of a batted ball's launch angle and exit velocity that closely match the objective measurement. The scaling is also spread out enough to distinguish points of different exit velocities and launch angles. The positioning sufficiently avoids interference with other channels. It also does not make any points pop out, but usually color compensates for this effect if necessary. With the help of annotated markings distinguishing ground balls, line drives, fly balls, pop-ups, and  home runs, the positioning helps to contribute to the noteworthy groupings in this data set. As a result, both effectiveness and expressiveness principles are followed.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Color --> Saturation + Hue
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Represents attribute of ordered (ordinal, diverging) type.</li>
                                    <li>This is a questionable mapping. Though the different shades of points do help to display the varying levels of angles and velocities, points do overlap each other, so it is hard to distinguish each of them and their respective values. Therefore, the points are not very discriminated. However, it makes sense logically for darker colors to represent extremes in the data set (below or above average scoring values) and for lighter ones to represent values closer to the average. Our perceptual judgment of the scoring value a point represents could hence agree with an objective measurement of it. The colors don't really interfere much with other channels, and the dark orange blob on the plot effectively pops out the points symbolizing home runs, helping to accentuate the ideal "sweet spot" combination of launch angle and velocity for a home run. Finally, the colors on the plot seem to group the data into noticeable chunks, but these chunks don't seem particularly meaningful. The only significant chunk of color is the aforementioned orange blob representing home runs. Pop-ups, fly balls, line drives, and ground balls are all distinctive categories that are better inferred via the positioning of the points, rather than the color. Whether this visualization follows the effectiveness principle is questionable, but it is clear that the expressiveness principle is used because the saturation level/hue of the points convey an ordering exists. The distinction between below average, average, and above average scoring values is clearly interpreted as ordinal data. The white helps to clearly indicate whether a value is average, emphasizing the data is divergent. </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                    <br><h2>Colormap(s)</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Divergent
                            <ul>
                                <li>Represents attribute of ordered divergent type (range from below to average to above average limits).</li>
                                <li>This mapping is good because ordered divergent attributes are best represented by divergent color maps. Clearly, two colors (purple and orange) are used to represent the two extremes within the data, which are below versus above average scoring values. In theory, white would have been a good choice for representing the "average" of the data since it's a neutral color. For this visualization specifically, though, it's a poor choice of color since it blends easily with the background of the visualization and could be misinterpreted as "no data" rather than "average data." No illusions are created via saturation, mark typing and sizing, simultaneous contrast, or the Von Bezold Spreading Effect.</li>

                <!-- Identifying the marks, channels, and colormap(s) of the third visualization -->
                <div id="marks-and-channels" class="lower-paragraph">
                    <br><h2>Marks</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lines</li>

                                <li>Represents attribute of categorical (horizontal spacing) and quantitative (vertical spacing) type.</li>
                                <li>This is a good mapping because it makes use of both vertical and horizontal spaces to clearly display the two attributes of the data. The vertical spacing logically makes sense: the taller a bar, the greater the average total of a certain Pokémon type. Hence, the use of a vertical axis that allows one to perceptually measure each bar on a common scale allows one to easily compare the Pokémon type's average totals, which are quantitative data. Furthermore, the bars are vertically scaled effectively and match our human perceptual judgement to the objective measurement of an average total. The levels of the channel are clearly discriminated due to how the scaling of the y-axis makes it easy to distinguish the differences in height across each bar. Also, each level of Pokémon type is differentiable due to the excellent horizontal positioning of the bar chart. The positioning channels also exist independently enough of others so that the visualization isn't hard to interpret, even though both the horizontal positioning and hues of the bars are used to indicate a Pokémon's type. The dragon bar appropriately pops out from the others due to its height to represent that dragon types are the strongest Pokémon overall. No groupings are intuitive based on the vertical or horizontal posistioning of the bars, which is ideal. The Pokémon's type, a categorical attribute, is used to disperse the bars along the horizontal axis. Perceptually, the horizontal spacing of the different categories of Pokémon type is a good way to express the categorical data. Thus, both the effectiveness and expressiveness principles are followed.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                                <li>Represents attribute of categorical type.</li>
                                <li>This is a good mapping because each hue is used to represent a different category (Pokémon type), which helps users to quickly identify each bar and understand that there is no existing ordering. Hue is a strong way to exhibit categorical data. Furthermore, this bar chart matches types with colors that semantically seem aligned. For instance, water types are logically symbolized in a blue bar, fire types are logically represented in a red bar, and grass types are logically represented in a green bar. The hue channel exists independently enough from other channels. The hues are also distinct enough to appropriately emphasize each type being portrayed on the bar chart. The colors of each bar have the same level of saturation and luminance, so no bar visually pops out. The height channel compensates for this, however. Perhaps some people might erroneously group certain Pokémon types together if they are represented by bars of similar colors, but the annotations on the horizontal axis clear up confusion on that matter. Hence, the hue channel follows both the principles of effectiveness and expressiveness. </li>

                                <li>This is a good mapping because the colors used are of different perceptually distant hues but similar saturation and luminescence.
