                            <li>Represents attribute of categorical type. </li>
                            <li>This is a good mapping because it follows the effectiveness principle and contributes to how digestible the visualization is. Each area is positioned relative to each other, which helps users differentiate between them and identify which one correlates to what U.S. state. Though position is not entirely what users depend on to identify the states, this channel does play a significant role in their ability to do so. The expressiveness principle is also followed because the way the information is shown does not imply an ordering exists among the categorical attributes.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Represents attribute of categorical type.</li>
                            <li>This is a good mapping because it plays a major role as to how well users are able to distinguish between each area and identify the state it represents, which shows how this channel follows the effectiveness principle. The expressiveness principle is followed as well because the way the information is shown does not imply an ordering exists among this categorical attribute.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Size --> Area
                        <ul>
                            <li>Represents attribute of categorical type.</li>
                            <li>This is an okay mapping because it works with position and shape to help users identify the corresponding U.S. states of each area, but does not greatly contribute to users' ability to do so. However, it still follows both the effectiveness and expressiveness principles because it helps to differentiate the states and doesn't imply an ordering.</li>

                            <li>This is a good mapping because it helps users clearly identify which party each states' electoral votes would have went to, which is the main data that the visualization is trying to convey to users. The visualization uses two distinct colors to represent each party, which shows that both the effectiveness and expressiveness principles are followed.</li>

                            <li>Represents attribute of categorical type (Clinton or Trump).</li>
                            <li>This is a good mapping. The colors used in this visualization are of similar saturation and value, but are perceptually different. From this, users can see that there are two distinct categories that the visualization is focusing on.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Points</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br><h2>Channels</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Position --> Both
                            <ul>
                                <li>Represents attribute of ordered (quantitative, diverging) type.</li>
                                <li>This is a good mapping. Each point has two corresponding attributes: launch angle and exit velocity. In this visualization, the creator was able to use both horizontal and vertical positioning of the point to clearly and efficiently display these attributes. Additionally, it shows that some sort of order does exist based on each point's horizontal and vertical position relative to other points. As a result, both effectiveness and expressiveness principles are followed.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Color --> Saturation + Hue
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Represents attribute of ordered (ordinal, sequential) type.</li>
                                    <li>This is a questionable mapping. Though the different shades of points do help to display the varying levels of angles and velocities, points do overlap each other so it is hard to distinguish each of them and their respective values. Whether the effectiveness principle is followed is questionable, but it is clear that the expressiveness principle is shown because the positioning and the saturation level/hue of the points convey an ordering exists.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                    <br><h2>Colormap(s)</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Divergent
                            <ul>
                                <li>Represents attribute of ordered divergent type (range from below to average to above average limits.</li>
                                <li>This mapping is good because ordered divergent attributes are best represented by divergent color maps. Clearly, two colors (purple and orange) are used to represent the two extrenes within the data values, which are below and above average limits. In theory, white would have been a good choice for representing the "average" of the data since it's a neutral color (for this visualization specifically, though, it's a poor choice of color since it blends easily with the background of the visualization and could be misinterpreted as "no data" rather than "average data."</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>



                <!-- Identifying the marks, channels, and colormap(s) of the third visualization -->
                <div id="marks-and-channels" class="lower-paragraph">
                    <br><h2>Marks</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lines</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br><h2>Channels</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Position --> Both
                            <ul>
                                <li>Represents attribute of categorical (horizontal spacing) and quantitative (vertical spacing) type.</li>
                                <li>This is a good mapping because it makes use of both vertical and horizontal spaces to clearly display the two attributes of the data. The vertical spacing logically makes sense: the taller a bar, the greater the average total of a certain Pokémon type. Hence, the use of a vertical axis that allows one to perceptually measure each bar on a common scale allows one to effectively compare the Pokémon type's average totals, which are quantitative data. Furthermore, the bars are scaled effectively and match human perceptual judgement to the objective measurement of an average total. The levels of the channel are clearly discriminable due to how vastly different the colors of each bar are how the scaling of the y-axis makes it easy to distinguish the differences in height across each bar. The channels exist independently of others as position and hue are fully separable. The colors of each bar have the same level of saturation, so no bar visually pops out, which isn't really necessary for interpreting this bar chart. Perhaps some people might erroneously group certain Pokémon types together if they are represented by bars of similar colors, but the annotations on the horizontal axis clear up confusion on that matter. The Pokémon's type, a categorical attribute, is used to disperse the bars along the horizontal axis. Perceptually, the horizontal spacing of the different categories of Pokémon type are a good way to express categorical data. Thus, both principles of effectiveness and expressiveness are followed.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>


                        <li>Color --> Hue
                            <ul>
                                <li>Represents attribute of categorical type.</li>
                                <li>This is a good mapping because each hue is used to represent a different category (Pokémon type), which helps users to be able to quickly identify each bar and understand that there is no existing ordering. Hue is a strong way to exhibit categorical data. Furthermore, this bar chart matches types with colors that semantically seem aligned. For instance, water types are logically symbolized in a blue bar, fire types are logically represented in a red bar, and grass types are logically represented in a green bar. This follows both the principles of effectiveness and expressiveness. No illusions are created via saturation, mark typing and sizing, simultaenous contrast, or the Von Bezold Spreading Effect.</li>
                            </ul>

                    <br><h2>Colormap(s)</h2>

                                <li>Represents attribute of categorical type.</li>
                                <li>This is a good mapping because the colors used are of different hues but similar saturation and luminance. As a result, it is clear that only one attribute (different categories of Pokemon) is being conveyed. Additionally, it is easy to distinguish between all categories.</li>
